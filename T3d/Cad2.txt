			Basic Techniques and Algorithms


CAD programs today are mostly based on GUI system and mostly for GUI type
operating systems.

GUI (Graphical User Interface) greatly simplifies using a program by
providing visual representaion for Tools, letting user better visualise
what  he/she shall be doing to solve the design problem, reducing useless
burden of meaningless command memorisation, minimising any burden on mind.

In Generalised opinion CAD requires certain basic graphical representation
techniques to be effective in visual representaion of problem.

- Line drawing algorithms(2D,3D)

- Co-ordinate system convertions(cartesian,cylendrical,spherical,
				 curvilenear)

- Circle, ellipse, sphere, ellipsoid algorithms

- Polygon drawing and filling algorithms

- Windowing Techniques and ViewPorts

- Perspective, Oblique, Parallel projection

- Surface modeling methods
			>Wire-Frame , Wire Mesh
			>Surface of revolution
			>Tabulated wave of 2, 3D curves
			>3D(N-D projected in 3d) functions(explicit, 
							   implicit)

- Rendering And Texture mapping
			>Flat shading
			>Gourad shading
			>Phong shading
			>Ray Tracing
				  >>Ambeint light source
				  >>Point light source
				  >>Distributed light source(on surface)
			>Picture format conversions(BMP,PCX)
			>Material definition

- Object Modeling and Definition File Interpretation

- Numerical Methods Library
			>High precision numbers
			>Application of Calculus
			>Analytic geometry
			>Chaos theory, error level analysis
			(over multiple calculations)
			{avoid error in significant level}

- Graphical input output library for hardware handling
	(with aspect ratio etc correction if required)

- Hardware Drivers or Libraries
			>Screen
			>Plotter/Printer
			>Mouse
