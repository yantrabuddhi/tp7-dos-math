Mathkit program is incapable of ^ func as it can't evaluate negative num 
raised  to power, hence can't give graph for (-1)^X.
Hence solution lies in creating modifications to calculate powers 
differently than by exp(pow*ln())
Also evaluation unit is too slow so speed up with several techniques 
including postfix -> infix
also see that raised to func can't give even root of neg nums in real number 
mode so give unreal err for that & include complex
& vector calcs with number base set eg: binary, hex etc.. options
3-d graphs with texture fill, light effect for more visibility(more colors)
