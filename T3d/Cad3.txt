By Todays Standards
Idealy a CAD software (for moderately complex designs) would require 
large display(>19 inches), with a high resolution and colour depth 
(1600*1200*1.6 million)(low eye fatigue,radiations), Large memory
(>128 MB) and computational power (>500 Mflops) for a really good 
Design capability.


For our use, harware is to be selected to be easily availible and
usable.. i.e information regarding use of harware and its programming
should be availible easily.


Display - 

IBM PC provides with a standard EGA/VGA adaptor for graphics
with capabilities of
			300*200*256
			and
			640*480*16

(vga- vedio graphics array)
i.e xsize*ysize*colours

 Both the modes are near useless for a good CAD

300*200*256 has too low a resolution with the need of aspect ratio 
correction as it does not match with general screen standard of 4:3.

640*480*16 has only 16 colours and is too slow in access, thus
unfit for good representation to eye and rendering etc.

The New VESA (Vedio Electronics Standards Association) standard for
high resolution SVGA(Super VGA) is today implemented in almost all
graphics cards on all PC's... provides with various modes
depending on capability of hardware(Screen, Graphics card, Vram).

it may provide any desirable combimation of modes and colour depths
resolutions of 640*480 to ones exceeding 1600*1200 at 8 to 24 bit colour 
depth.

To maintain compatibility to old system svga information is mapped into
the old allotted 64KB memory area. Since svga information exceeds 64KB
the svga card has its memory divided in 64KB banks which are paged to
the old area on request by program.

Resolutions of 
	-	640*480*1.6million
	-	800*600*64000
	-	1024*768*256

utilise less than 1MB of ram and are compatible with most of the display
devices . The last two modes are most widely supported, even over laptops
although larger no. of colours(24 bit) is very tempting in large variety 
of possible colours in the display(True Colour Mode).


Input devices -

Keyboard and Mouse are the selected input devices as thier drivers are 
readily availible for  for most Operating Systems.
If another graphics device driver is found or device and driver is 
designed by me for serial port it shall be added too.
(like a 3D positionable robotic arm with mouse type click button for
3D data input)


Computer - 

INTEL, AMD based IBM PC Clones are very popular ,cheap , easily availible,
rich in literature with lots of operating systems and languages availible.
Thus this shall be the natural choice.


Operating System -

Two most preffered OS's are

	MS DOS - (Real mode OS)
	MS WINDOWS9X - (Protected mode)

PC's based on 386 and above have 2 modes Real and Protected.
In real mode access is limited to 1MB of ram, program can access anything.
In protected mode the OS decides if a program has the right to have access
to any PC resource.
For Todays applications MS DOS provides too little, but then it gives
great flexibility and provides with all information to access any hardware
while windows requires device drivers etc. for which information is
very hard to find, also windows demands heavily on system.
Thus MS DOS is chosen for initial development.


Language-

Several languages are  
	MS DOS  -> Turbo PASCAL, c/c++, Assembly
	Windows -> Delphi, VC/VC++, Win Assembly

C++ is chosen for following reasons

- Standardised to ANSI
- Logic part, i.e non system specific code can be shared over different
  systems
- Large amount of availible litrature
- Numerous good coding facilities ans structures
	>>Object oriented
	>>templates
	>>streams
	>>function,operator overloading
	>>libraries

(Some c++ compilers come with built in Assembler and code optimiser)
